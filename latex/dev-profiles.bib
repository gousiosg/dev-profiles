	Abstract = {Software developers use various software repositories in order to interact with each other or to solve software related problems. They are required to adopt an identity for each of the software repositories they wanted to use. Quite often developers are also found on different code forges developing open source projects. It is worth mentioning that the information relevant to the developers are distributed on the Web among different data sources each requires an ID and an authentication mechanism. In this paper, we propose to interlink the identities of a developer across different data sources on the Web. Further, we show the benefit of integrating developer-related information from different data sources using some real-world scenarios.},
